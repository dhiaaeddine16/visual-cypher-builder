# Visual Cypher Builder 🔨
The **Visual Cypher Builder** is a user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of building graph queries in Neo4j's Cypher language. With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, it helps users — from beginners to experts — visually construct Cypher queries.  

Whether you're just starting with graph databases or looking for a faster way to build complex queries, this tool bridges the gap between abstract syntax and intuitive design.

You can try the prototype in your browser:
